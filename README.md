# Cretaceous Ecosystem Simulation – Serra da Galga  

**Simulating the Late Cretaceous ecosystem of Serra da Galga with Unity and AI-driven dinosaurs.**  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project is my undergraduate thesis in **Computer Science**.  
It consists of a **3D simulation in Unity** of an extinct ecosystem from the **Late Cretaceous period** in the region of **Serra da Galga (present-day Uberaba, Brazil)**.  

The simulation aims to recreate the paleoenvironment through **procedural terrain generation**, inspired by geological models of Serra da Galga during that time, and to populate it with the local fauna (mainly dinosaurs) whose behaviors will be driven by **artificial intelligence**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Recreate a plausible **Cretaceous ecosystem** based on geological and paleontological references.  
- Implement **AI-driven agents** (dinosaurs) to simulate interactions between species.  
- Provide a **log system** to record actions, allowing simulations to run for hundreds or thousands of in-game years, so results can be analyzed retrospectively.  
- Introduce **environmental changes over time**, such as seasonal floods, erosion, and climate shifts.  
- Explore the possibility of **user interaction**, where the player/researcher can trigger events (e.g., volcanic eruptions, droughts, introduction of new species).

## 🔧 Features (Planned)  
- **Procedural Terrain Generation** – terrain inspired by Serra da Galga’s Late Cretaceous landscape.  
- **Simple 3D Models** – placeholder models for fauna and flora, with potential improvements depending on project timeline.  
- **AI-Driven Dinosaurs** – behaviors programmed to simulate feeding, hunting, migration, and survival.  
- **Action Log System** – record and analyze ecological interactions across simulated centuries.  
- **Environmental Dynamics** – seasonal and long-term changes (floods, erosion, climate effects).  
- **User-Triggered Events** – tools to interfere with the ecosystem and observe consequences.

## 🌱 Goals of the Simulation  
The main purpose of this project is not to create a hyper-realistic simulation, but rather to analyze whether the interactions between species appear **plausible, emergent, or even unexpected/innovative**. The ecosystem will serve as both a research and experimentation environment.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Unity 3D** – main development engine.  
- **C#** – for AI behavior and simulation logic.
